# COMP1004 Main Project - Task Planner
This is the COMP1004 main project. The objective is to develop a single page application that helps users manage time and explore the possibility of utilising the Alexa Skills technology.

## Overview
This application is a time management tool where users can plan their projects / tasks to be more efficient and remember upcoming deadlines.
The application allows users to create objectives and categorise them to their preferred structure.

**Currently Implemented Features:**
- Task creation which includes a due date, starting date, priority and description.
- Category creation for better organised time management plan.
- Board creation for a way of organising time management plans into seperate views.
- Sorting tasks and categories by dragging and dropping them.
- A popup reminder of upcoming deadlines opening the board.

## Architecture
The front-end of the application was built entirely with JavaScript using the React framework and Firebase was used for the back-end which provided me an easy way of implementing a database and authentication using a single service.
