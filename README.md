# COMP1004 Main Project - Task Planner
This is the COMP1004 main project. The objective was to develop a single page application that helps users manage time and explore the possibility of utilising the Alexa Skills technology.

## Overview
This application is a time management tool where users can plan their projects / tasks to be more efficient and remember upcoming deadlines.
The application allows users to create objectives and categorise them to their preferred structure.

**Currently Implemented Features:**
- Users are able to create accounts to save their data and access it online.
- Task creation which includes a due date, starting date, priority and description.
- Category creation for better organised time management plan.
- Board creation for a way of organising time management plans into seperate views.
- Sorting tasks and categories by dragging and dropping them.
- A popup reminder of upcoming deadlines opening the board.

## Architecture

### Front-End
The front-end was built using JavaScript, React and a few libraries to help me with some features of the application, such as React Router to handle site routing and React Redux for easy and effective global state management.

### Back-End
For the back-end I used Firebase which is a service that provides a simple solution for storing data and authenticating users.

### Other Tools & Techniques
I used SASS (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) to style my application, mainly for its simple approach to style nesting and re-usability.
