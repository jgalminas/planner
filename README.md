# Task Management Application
## 💡 Background
This is a task management application that I built during my first university year for the Computing Practice module. I continued working on it for some time afterwards as well. The aim of this project was to create something related to time management that utilizes local browser storage, however, I wanted to make it a little more challenging for myself so I implemented much more than required. 

Using this tool users can plan and prioritise their projects and tasks to be more efficient and deliver work consistently and on time. The application follows a kanban board type of approach where users can create and categorise their objectives.

## ✨ Features
Here are some of the features of this project:

✅ Ability to create accounts and access data online <br>
✅ Breaking up objectives into smaller tasks <br>
✅ Categorising objectives <br>
✅ Ability to create workspaces to separate objectives <br>
✅ Ability to quickly drag objectives and categories to sort them

<em> As a side note, this application is not something I would consider a full product, therefore, some of the features may still be partially functional
or lack polish. </em>

## ⚙️ Architecture
### 💻  Front-End
The front-end was built using JavaScript, React and a few other libraries to help me with some of the aforementioned features. Such as React Router to handle site routing, React Redux for easy and effective global state management and Dnd-Kit for dragging and dropping capabilities.

### ☁️ Back-End
For the back-end, I used Firebase — a service that provides a simple solution for storing data and authenticating users.

### 🧰 Other Tools & Techniques
I used SASS (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) to style my application, mainly for its intuitive approach to style nesting and re-usability.
